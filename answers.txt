1. s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

2. client socket is active, it sends a connection request and waits for a response from server. server socket is passive, it waits for connection requests from clients, processes the requests and returns the reply

3. Add socket.SO_REUSEADDR option when creating socket, like:
   s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

4. The IP address and port number of the connected client.

5. The data sent from the client, also the data need to be echo back. In this case, it is "Foobar".
